Chen\n\nSummary: Ethical frameworks for the use of natural language processing (NLP) are\nurgently needed to shape how large language models (LLMs) and similar tools are\nused for healthcare applications. Healthcare faces existing challenges\nincluding the balance of power in clinician-patient relationships, systemic\nhealth disparities, historical injustices, and economic constraints. Drawing\ndirectly from the voices of those most affected, and focusing on a case study\nof a specific healthcare setting, we propose a set of guiding principles for\nthe use of NLP in maternal healthcare. We led an interactive session centered\non an LLM-based chatbot demonstration during a full-day workshop with 39\nparticipants, and additionally surveyed 30 healthcare workers and 30 birthing\npeople about their values, needs, and perceptions of NLP tools in the context\nof maternal health. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of the\nsurvey results and interactive discussions to consolidate our findings into a\nset of guiding principles. We propose nine principles for ethical use of NLP\nfor maternal healthcare, grouped into three themes: (i) recognizing contextual\nsignificance (ii) holistic measurements, and (iii) who/what is valued. For each\nprinciple, we describe its underlying rationale and provide practical advice.\nThis set of principles can provide a methodological pattern for other\nresearchers and serve as a resource to practitioners working on maternal health\nand other healthcare fields to emphasize the importance of technical nuance,\nhistorical context, and inclusive design when developing NLP technologies for\nclinical use.",

We explore specialized pre-training to\nadapt smaller LLMs to different healthcare datasets. Three methods are\nassessed: traditional masked language modeling, Deep Contrastive Learning for\nUnsupervised Textual Representations (DeCLUTR), and a novel pre-training\nobjective utilizing metadata categories from the healthcare settings. These\nschemes are evaluated on downstream document classification tasks for each\ndataset, with additional analysis of the resultant embedding spaces.\nContrastively trained models outperform other approaches on the classification\ntasks, delivering strong performance from limited labeled data and with fewer\nmodel parameter updates required. While metadata-based pre-training does not\nfurther improve classifications across the datasets, it yields interesting\nembedding cluster separability. All domain adapted LLMs outperform their\npublicly available general base LLM, validating the importance of\ndomain-specialization. This research illustrates efficient approaches to\ninstill healthcare competency in compact LLMs even under tight computational\nbudgets, an essential capability for responsible and sustainable deployment in\nlocal healthcare settings.

Shamim Hossain\n\nSummary: Secure data management and effective data sharing have become paramount in\nthe rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, especially with the growing\nintegration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The rise of generative\nartificial intelligence has further elevated Multi-modal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) as essential tools for managing and optimizing healthcare data in IoMT.\nMLLMs can support multi-modal inputs and generate diverse types of content by\nleveraging large-scale training on vast amounts of multi-modal data. However,\ncritical challenges persist in developing medical MLLMs, including security and\nfreshness issues of healthcare data, affecting the output quality of MLLMs. To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-empowered medical MLLM framework for healthcare data management. This\nframework leverages a hierarchical cross-chain architecture to facilitate\nsecure data training. Moreover, it enhances the output quality of MLLMs through\nhybrid RAG, which employs multi-modal metrics to filter various unimodal RAG\nresults and incorporates these retrieval results as additional inputs to MLLMs.\nAdditionally, we employ age of information to indirectly evaluate the data\nfreshness impact of MLLMs and utilize contract theory to incentivize healthcare\ndata holders to share their fresh data, mitigating information asymmetry during\ndata sharing. Finally, we utilize a generative diffusion model-based deep\nreinforcement learning algorithm to identify the optimal contract for efficient\ndata sharing. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nschemes, which achieve secure and efficient healthcare data management.",

    "content": "Title: HealthQ: Unveiling Questioning Capabilities of LLM Chains in Healthcare Conversations\n\nAuthors: Ziyu Wang, Hao Li, Di Huang, Amir M. Rahmani\n\nSummary: In digital healthcare, large language models (LLMs) have primarily been\nutilized to enhance question-answering capabilities and improve patient\ninteractions. However, effective patient care necessitates LLM chains that can\nactively gather information by posing relevant questions. This paper presents\nHealthQ, a novel framework designed to evaluate the questioning capabilities of\nLLM healthcare chains. We implemented several LLM chains, including\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain of Thought (CoT), and reflective\nchains, and introduced an LLM judge to assess the relevance and informativeness\nof the generated questions. To validate HealthQ, we employed traditional\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) metrics such as Recall-Oriented Understudy\nfor Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) and Named Entity Recognition (NER)-based set\ncomparison, and constructed two custom datasets from public medical note\ndatasets, ChatDoctor and MTS-Dialog. Our contributions are threefold: we\nprovide the first comprehensive study on the questioning capabilities of LLMs\nin healthcare conversations, develop a novel dataset generation pipeline, and\npropose a detailed evaluation methodology.",

    "content": "Title: Are Large Language Models True Healthcare Jacks-of-All-Trades? Benchmarking Across Health Professions Beyond Physician Exams\n\nAuthors: Zheheng Luo, Chenhan Yuan, Qianqian Xie, Sophia Ananiadou\n\nSummary: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their\npotential in delivering accurate answers to questions about world knowledge.\nDespite this, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in healthcare\npredominantly focus on medical doctors, leaving other critical healthcare\nprofessions underrepresented. To fill this research gap, we introduce the\nExaminations for Medical Personnel in Chinese (EMPEC), a pioneering large-scale\nhealthcare knowledge benchmark in traditional Chinese. EMPEC consists of\n157,803 exam questions across 124 subjects and 20 healthcare professions,\nincluding underrepresented occupations like Optometrists and Audiologists. Each\nquestion is tagged with its release time and source, ensuring relevance and\nauthenticity. We conducted extensive experiments on 17 LLMs, including\nproprietary, open-source models, general domain models and medical specific\nmodels, evaluating their performance under various settings. Our findings\nreveal that while leading models like GPT-4 achieve over 75\\% accuracy, they\nstill struggle with specialized fields and alternative medicine. Surprisingly,\ngeneral-purpose LLMs outperformed medical-specific models, and incorporating\nEMPEC's training data significantly enhanced performance. Additionally, the\nresults on questions released after the models' training cutoff date were\nconsistent with overall performance trends, suggesting that the models'\nperformance on the test set can predict their effectiveness in addressing\nunseen healthcare-related queries. The transition from traditional to\nsimplified Chinese characters had a negligible impact on model performance,\nindicating robust linguistic versatility. Our study underscores the importance\nof expanding benchmarks to cover a broader range of healthcare professions to\nbetter assess the applicability of LLMs in real-world healthcare scenarios.",

    "content": "Title: Large Language Models Illuminate a Progressive Pathway to Artificial Healthcare Assistant: A Review\n\nAuthors: Mingze Yuan, Peng Bao, Jiajia Yuan, Yunhao Shen, Zifan Chen, Yi Xie, Jie Zhao, Yang Chen, Li Zhang, Lin Shen, Bin Dong\n\nSummary: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, large language models\n(LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in mimicking human-level language\ncomprehension and reasoning. This has sparked significant interest in applying\nLLMs to enhance various aspects of healthcare, ranging from medical education\nto clinical decision support. However, medicine involves multifaceted data\nmodalities and nuanced reasoning skills, presenting challenges for integrating\nLLMs. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the applications and\nimplications of LLMs in medicine. It begins by examining the fundamental\napplications of general-purpose and specialized LLMs, demonstrating their\nutilities in knowledge retrieval, research support, clinical workflow\nautomation, and diagnostic assistance. Recognizing the inherent multimodality\nof medicine, the review then focuses on multimodal LLMs, investigating their\nability to process diverse data types like medical imaging and EHRs to augment\ndiagnostic accuracy. To address LLMs' limitations regarding personalization and\ncomplex clinical reasoning, the paper explores the emerging development of\nLLM-powered autonomous agents for healthcare. Furthermore, it summarizes the\nevaluation methodologies for assessing LLMs' reliability and safety in medical\ncontexts. Overall, this review offers an extensive analysis on the\ntransformative potential of LLMs in modern medicine. It also highlights the\npivotal need for continuous optimizations and ethical oversight before these\nmodels can be effectively integrated into clinical practice.

    "content": "Title: Leveraging Large Language Models for Patient Engagement: The Power of Conversational AI in Digital Health\n\nAuthors: Bo Wen, Raquel Norel, Julia Liu, Thaddeus Stappenbeck, Farhana Zulkernine, Huamin Chen\n\nSummary: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new\nopportunities for transforming patient engagement in healthcare through\nconversational AI. This paper presents an overview of the current landscape of\nLLMs in healthcare, specifically focusing on their applications in analyzing\nand generating conversations for improved patient engagement. We showcase the\npower of LLMs in handling unstructured conversational data through four case\nstudies: (1) analyzing mental health discussions on Reddit, (2) developing a\npersonalized chatbot for cognitive engagement in seniors, (3) summarizing\nmedical conversation datasets, and (4) designing an AI-powered patient\nengagement system. These case studies demonstrate how LLMs can effectively\nextract insights and summarizations from unstructured dialogues and engage\npatients in guided, goal-oriented conversations. Leveraging LLMs for\nconversational analysis and generation opens new doors for many\npatient-centered outcomes research opportunities. However, integrating LLMs\ninto healthcare raises important ethical considerations regarding data privacy,\nbias, transparency, and regulatory compliance. We discuss best practices and\nguidelines for the responsible development and deployment of LLMs in healthcare\nsettings. Realizing the full potential of LLMs in digital health will require\nclose collaboration between the AI and healthcare professionals communities to\naddress technical challenges and ensure these powerful tools' safety, efficacy,\nand equity.",

    "content": "Title: Healthcare Copilot: Eliciting the Power of General LLMs for Medical Consultation\n\nAuthors: Zhiyao Ren, Yibing Zhan, Baosheng Yu, Liang Ding, Dacheng Tao\n\nSummary: The copilot framework, which aims to enhance and tailor large language models\n(LLMs) for specific complex tasks without requiring fine-tuning, is gaining\nincreasing attention from the community. In this paper, we introduce the\nconstruction of a Healthcare Copilot designed for medical consultation. The\nproposed Healthcare Copilot comprises three main components: 1) the Dialogue\ncomponent, responsible for effective and safe patient interactions; 2) the\nMemory component, storing both current conversation data and historical patient\ninformation; and 3) the Processing component, summarizing the entire dialogue\nand generating reports. To evaluate the proposed Healthcare Copilot, we\nimplement an auto-evaluation scheme using ChatGPT for two roles: as a virtual\npatient engaging in dialogue with the copilot, and as an evaluator to assess\nthe quality of the dialogue. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed\nHealthcare Copilot significantly enhances the capabilities of general LLMs for\nmedical consultations in terms of inquiry capability, conversational fluency,\nresponse accuracy, and safety. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to\nhighlight the contribution of each individual module in the Healthcare Copilot.\nCode will be made publicly available on GitHub.",

If requested, a University staff \nmember will assist in making the report to the police. \n• Anonymous incident reports can also be made by using the campus security authority \nonline report form. The report form can be found at www.ou.edu/clery/reporting . \nConfidential Reporting \nThe University will protect the confidentiality of victims. Only those with a need to know \nthe identity for purposes of investigating the crime, assisting the victim, or disciplining the \nperpetrator will know the victim’s identity. \nPursuant to the University’s sexual misconduct policy, when an employee who is not a \nconfidential resource becomes aware of alleged misconduct under that policy (including, but \nnot limited to, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking), the employee \nis responsible for reporting that information, including the status of the parties if known, to \nthe Title IX Coordinator. A victim of other types of crimes (e.g., aggravated assault, burglary, \netc.) who does not want to pursue action within the University disciplinary system or the \ncriminal justice system is nevertheless encouraged to make a confidential report to a campus \nsecurity authority. Upon the victim’s request, a report of the details of the incident can be \nfiled with the University without revealing the victim’s identity. Such a confidential report \ncomplies with the victim’s wishes but still helps the University take appropriate steps to ensure \nthe future safety of the victim and others. With such information, the University can keep an \naccurate record of the number of incidents involving members of the campus community, \ndetermine where a pattern of crime may be developing and alert the community to any \npotential danger. These confidential reports are counted and disclosed in the annual crime \nstatistics for the University.  \nThe University encourages its professional counselors, if and when they deem it appropriate, \nto inform the person they are counseling to report crimes on a voluntary, confidential basis \nfor inclusion in the annual report of crime statistics. The University does not have pastoral \ncounselors. \nSecurity of and Access to Campus Facilities \nAll academic buildings are secured during the evenings and weekends. During this time, access \nto the buildings is only allowed for faculty/staff members and students with authorized card \naccess or University-issued keys. The University Village Apartments are secured automatically \nby access control. The clubhouse entrance is unlocked from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through \nFriday. An authorized key card is required for entry at all other times. Security Officers check \nthe apartments throughout the night to ensure they remain secure. They also perform random \nrounds or “walk-throughs” any time between 9 p.m. and 5:30 a.m. The security officers also \nperform foot patrols of parking lots and surrounding areas. \nStudents and employees are asked to be alert and to not circumvent practices and procedures \nthat are meant to preserve their safety and that of others. \n• Do not prop doors open or allow strangers into campus buildings that have been \nsecured. \n• Do not lend keys or access cards to non-students and do not leave them unattended.",

The universities must also comply with the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act, \nwhich describes the drug-free policies required at workplaces with certain federal contracts. \nFurthermore, the two Universities must also comply with the Federal Controlled Substances \nAct (FCSA), which criminalizes the growth and use of marijuana.\nDespite the recent passage of State Question 788, the DFSCA requires OSU and OU to adopt \nand adhere to policies prohibiting the unlawful use, possession or distribution of illegal drugs, \nincluding marijuana. Moving forward, OU and OSU will adhere to federal law prohibiting \nthe use, possession, distribution or cultivation of marijuana for any reason at their campuses \nacross the state. Additionally, federal law also prohibits the use and distribution of marijuana \nfor any reason at events authorized or supervised by OSU and OU. Even with the evolving state \nlaw permitting marijuana use for medical reasons, it is important for students and employees \nto know they cannot consume, smoke or possess marijuana on campus even though they might \nhave a card or prescription permitting them to do so.\nDrug Screening for Students Attending a Clinical Rotation Setting\nAt the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences, all students in designated degree programs \nthat involve clinical experiences must undergo drug screening. This includes clinical rotations \nand any other clinical-based experiential learning. Drug screening is a requirement of the \naffiliated healthcare facilities. Students should check with their specific college or degree \nprogram for detailed requirements.

These programs are discussed below. \nEach semester, the University provides information to students and employees regarding the \nUniversity’s security procedures and practices. This information is in multiple forms, including \npresentations, posters, handouts, articles in the University newsletter and email blasts. Among \nother things, it advises students and employees of the importance of reporting criminal \nactivity, to whom crimes should be reported, being responsible for their own safety and the \nsafety of others’ and practices regarding the University’s emergency notification system and \nthe issuance of timely warnings (Critical Alerts) and emergency notifications (Emergency \nAlerts). \nCrime prevention programs are also presented throughout the academic year by Student \nAffairs and OUPD-Tulsa. Presentations outline ways to maintain personal safety. In addition, \nemail blasts are periodically sent to students and employees with crime prevention and other \nsafety tips. Additional information is available through the OUPD-Tulsa website, www.ou.edu/\ntulsa/police. \nMonitoring Off Campus Locations of Recognized Student Organizations \nOU-Tulsa does not have any student organizations officially recognized by the University that \nown or control off-campus locations, including off-campus housing facilities.   \nDisclosure of the Outcome of a Crime of Violence or Non-Forcible Sex \nOffense \nUpon written request, the University will disclose to the alleged victim of a crime of violence \n(as that term is defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code), or a non-forcible sex \noffense, the report on the results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by the University \nagainst a student who is the alleged perpetrator of such crime or offense. If the alleged victim is \ndeceased as a result of such crime or offense, the next of kin of such victim shall be treated as \nthe alleged victim for the paragraph’s purposes. \nThe previous paragraph does not apply to victims of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual \nassault or stalking because under the Violence Against Women Act, both the accused and \naccuser in these cases are given the results without the need to make a written request.",

They also perform random rounds or “walk-throughs” in residence halls any time \nbetween 9 p.m. and 5:30 a.m. The security officers also perform foot patrols of parking lots and \nsurrounding areas.\nStudents and employees are asked to be alert and to not circumvent practices and procedures \nthat are meant to preserve their safety and that of others.\n• Do not prop doors open or allow strangers into campus buildings that have been \nsecured.\n• Do not lend keys or access cards to non-students and do not leave them unattended.\n• Do not give access codes to anyone who does not belong to the campus community.\nKeys to the offices, laboratories, and classrooms on campus will be issued to employees only as \nneeded and after receiving the proper authorization. Each department supervisor is responsible \nfor ensuring their area is secured and locked.\nEmployee and student SoonerCards may be used to verify the identity of persons suspected to \nbe in campus facilities without permission.\nSecurity Considerations in the Maintenance of Facilities\nCampus police officers and Community Service Officers (CSOs/uniformed security personnel) \nreport any observed damage to security hardware, non-operational lights or other potential \nfacility maintenance security problems to Facilities Management Customer Service for repair.\nFacilities Management is responsible for day-to-day maintenance and repair of all campus",

This report covers January 1, 2022 – December 31, 2023.\nThe Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (DFSCA) requires all institutions of higher \neducation to certify that they have implemented programs to prevent the abuse of alcohol and \nuse and/or distribution of illicit drugs both by students and employees either on its premises \nand as part of any of its activities. At minimum, an institution of higher education must \nannually distribute the following in writing to all students and employees:\ni. Standards of conduct that clearly prohibit the unlawful possession, use, or distri-\nbution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students and employees;\nii. A description of the legal sanctions under local, state, or federal law for the unlaw-\nful possession or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol;\niii. A description of the health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and alcohol \nabuse;\niv. A description of any drug or alcohol counseling, treatment, or rehabilitation or \nreentry programs that are available to employees or students; and\nv. A clear statement that the institution will impose sanctions on students and em -\nployees and a description of those sanctions, up to and including expulsion or \ntermination of employment and referral for prosecution, for violations of the \nstandards of conduct or law.\nThe Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, after consultation with students, faculty, \nand staff, developed the Policy on Prevention of Alcohol Abuse and Drug Use on Campus and \nin the Workplace, as required by the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. This policy, \nwhich is reviewed annually and was recently updated, provides a description of the standards \nof conduct that prohibit the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and \nalcohol on University property or as part of any University-sponsored activities; a description \nof applicable legal sanctions under local, state or federal laws for the unlawful possession or \ndistribution of illicit drugs and alcohol; a description of the health risks associated with the \nuse of illicit drugs and abuse of alcohol; a description of Employee Assistance Programs and \nStudent Counseling Programs; and, a clear statement of sanctions imposed for violations of the \nstandards of conduct. This policy is distributed annually to all students and employees.\nStandards of Conduct\nStudents\nThe Student Alcohol Policy is available in the student handbook and through various",

These recommendations \nmay involve adjustments to policies, enhancements to educational initiatives, or the \nintroduction of new interventions. Clear action plans are formulated to implement these \nrecommendations, fostering a continuous improvement cycle.\nProgram Element 5: Data-Driven Decision-Making\nThe Biennial Review Committee utilizes data collection and assessment tools to inform \ndecision-making. This includes gathering information on the prevalence of alcohol and drug \nuse, the effectiveness of prevention initiatives, and the overall impact on the community. The \ninsights derived from data analysis guide evidence-based strategies and adjustments to the \nprogram.\nAOD Program Strengths and Weaknesses\nStrengths:\n1. Comprehensive Oversight: The Biennial Review is conducted by a dedicated committee, \nensuring a thorough and systematic examination of AOD policies and programs. This \ncomprehensive oversight contributes to the effectiveness and compliance of the AOD \nprogram.\n2. Stakeholder Collaboration: The Biennial Review Committee actively collaborates with \nvarious stakeholders, including campus and community partners. This collaborative \napproach fosters a diverse and inclusive perspective, enriching the prevention strategies \nwith varied insights and resources.\n3. Environmental Strategy Implementation: The AOD program strategically addresses the \nsocial, legal, economic, and physical environment through the five environmental strat-\negies. This approach ensures a multifaceted intervention, targeting the various factors \ninfluencing alcohol use decisions on campus. These programs and tactics include:\n• Providing a mandatory online alcohol education program to all incoming \nundergraduate students, including transfer students, age 20 and under, on \nthe Norman campus.\n• Requiring a Face-to-face alcohol education program for all first-year housing \nresidents and commuter students in Norman.\n• Integrating mandatory alcohol education sessions into Residence Life cur-\nriculum through the Comprehensive Alcohol Program which is facilitated by \ntrained Peer Educators.\n• Providing Tailored mandatory alcohol education sessions for fraternity and \nsorority members, student athletes, marching band members, Norman cam-\npus international students, and students in health classes.",

The University strives to complete investigations of \nthis nature within sixty (60) to ninety (90) business days.\nThe process for filing a Complaint of Employee Sexual Misconduct or Sexual Misconduct \n(Student Code Violation) is the same as the process for filing a Formal Complaint of Title IX \nSexual Harassment, except that prior to initiating an investigation into the alleged conduct, \nthe Title IX Coordinator must first request authorization to investigate from the Chief \nHuman Resources Officer or Director of Student Conduct, who will determine whether the \nUniversity has jurisdictional authority to impose disciplinary sanctions on the Respondent \npursuant to the applicable Staff and Faculty Handbook provisions or Student Code of Rights \nand Responsibilities, as applicable. Once a Complaint is filed, the Complaint procedures will \nfollow the same procedure for a Formal Complaint of Title IX Sexual Harassment except where \nspecifically noted herein or in the Grievance Procedures for Formal Complaints of Title IX \nSexual Harassment or Sexual Misconduct available at https://www.ou.edu/eoo/policies-and-\nprocedures.\nBoth parties have an equal opportunity to appeal the determination by filing a written appeal \nwith the Title IX Coordinator within five (5) university business days of being notified of \nthe outcome of the investigation. The non-appealing party will be notified of the appeal \nand permitted to submit a written statement in response. The Title IX Coordinator shall \nprovide the Appeal and Response to the appropriate Appellate Decisionmaker. The Appellate \nDecisionmaker shall enter a Decision of Appeal within ten (10) University business days after \nthe parties’ statements, if any, are received. The appellate Decision-maker is not the same \nperson as the Decision-maker entering the Determination, the Title IX Coordinator, or the \nInvestigator.\nAt any time after the filing of a Formal Complaint but not less than ten (10) University \nbusiness days prior to a Live Hearing, either party may request that the University facilitate an \ninformal resolution. Informal resolution is an available option when both parties voluntarily \nagree to participate in writing and if the Title IX Coordinator agrees that informal resolution \nis appropriate given the nature of the allegations and the relationship of the parties. Informal \nresolution will not be facilitated in cases involving a student Complainant and employee \nRespondent. To allow the parties to participate without concern for how their statements may \naffect the outcome of an investigation, the Title IX Coordinator and Office of Institutional Equity \nstaff will not participate in informal resolution. If the parties reach agreement during the informal \nresolution process, the facilitator will reduce the agreement to writing and present it to the Title \nIX Coordinator, who may approve or disapprove the agreement. An approved informal resolution \nagreement will be recognized as a binding agreement between the parties enforceable by the \nUniversity. Once the parties have entered into an approved informal resolution agreement, the \ngrievance will be deemed resolved and may not be re-opened. At any time prior to agreeing to a \nresolution, any party has the right to withdraw from the informal resolution process and resume \nthe grievance process with respect to the Formal Complaint. If any party declines to participate in \nthe informal resolution process chooses to withdraw from participation, or if informal resolution \nis not successful, the grievance process continues.",
